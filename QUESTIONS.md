it appears that rails controllers trigger the view but the view itself reaches into the model for the data it needs - true?
do they prefer brackets or no? linkto("Pretty", say_hello_path)?
how  do you decide what goes in the view helper and what goes directly in the controller

pluralising table names is controversial, some DBAs reckon the table name should refer to what one record in it represents - what do rabid guys do/think about this?


how do views map to layouts?

Q: is it a terrible idea to mix the rails automagic js and custom stuff?
