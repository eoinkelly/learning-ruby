# rails routing is http://<server-name>/<controller-name/<action-name>
# rails calls methods within controllser "action methods"
# each action method typically has it's own view
# in erb the <% %> and <%= %> are different!
# activepack is the rails component that implemetns controllers and views
# activerecord is the rails component that implemetns models

# writing tests first lets us test whether the test itself works as we actually
# see the red and green states. if we wrote test after implemetation we would
# have to comment out the implementation to test the red state - this takes
# longer.

# running your test in the red state checks for any problems in the test itself - you can check that it is actually failing in the expected way

# a class is a combination of state and methods
